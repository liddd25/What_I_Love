          <h2>Fyodor Dostoevsky</h2>
          <p>Fyodor Dostoevsky (1821–1881) was one of the most influential writers in world literature, known for his deep exploration of psychology, morality, and faith. Born in Moscow, he was raised in a religious but troubled household, experiences that would later shape the emotional depth of his writing. Though trained as an engineer, Dostoevsky’s true passion was literature. His first novel, Poor Folk (1846), earned him early recognition.
In 1849, Dostoevsky was arrested for participating in a group that discussed radical ideas. He was sentenced to death, but the execution was staged and canceled at the last moment—a traumatic experience that deeply influenced his worldview. He spent four years in a Siberian labor camp, followed by military service. These years of suffering and reflection strengthened his Christian beliefs and shaped the moral questions found in his later works.
After returning to society, Dostoevsky wrote some of the most significant novels in literary history, including Crime and Punishment, The Idiot, Demons, and The Brothers Karamazov. These works deal with guilt, free will, redemption, and the struggle between good and evil. Despite his success, he faced personal hardships, including epilepsy, debt, and a gambling addiction.
Dostoevsky died in 1881, but his legacy lives on. He influenced countless writers, philosophers, and psychologists. His ability to portray the inner conflicts of the human soul continues to resonate, making him a central figure in both literature and thought.</p>
